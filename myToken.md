### Installing

* There is no need to install and download the program
* There are no modifications needed to be made in the files/folders

### Executing program

* To execute the program, access to an Ethereum development environment, such as Remix, is needed.
* Copy and paste the code to the Ethereum development environment.
* Interact with the contract through its functions:
1. Use the mint function to create and assign tokens to Ethereum addresses.
2. Use the burn function to destroy tokens from Ethereum addresses.
